Analysis of barcoding and RFID technologies and their impact on inventory accuracy, safety stock, and production planning.

# Inventory Systems Analysis: Barcoding vs RFID

## Project Overview
This project analyzes how identification technologies—barcoding and RFID—impact inventory accuracy, safety stock levels, and production planning in modern production systems.

The analysis connects production systems theory with real-world implementations to show how better inventory visibility reduces uncertainty, waste, and operating cost.

## Problem Statement
Inaccurate inventory records increase safety stock, cause stockouts, and degrade production planning decisions. Identification technologies aim to reduce these inefficiencies by improving the accuracy and speed of data capture.

## Scope of Analysis
- Barcoding vs RFID: cost, speed, accuracy, and scalability
- Deterministic and stochastic inventory models (EOQ, ROP, Safety Stock)
- Integration with MRP, CRP, and ERP systems
- Production Planning & Control (PPC) perspective
- Real-world case study: Zara’s RFID implementation

## Quantitative Analysis
A continuous-review (Q, R) inventory model was used to demonstrate how improved inventory visibility reduces demand variability during lead time, leading to:
- Lower safety stock
- Reduced annual holding cost
- Improved service levels

## Key Findings
- Improved inventory information reduces uncertainty, not demand itself
- RFID can significantly reduce safety stock and holding costs when applied correctly
- Barcoding and RFID are complementary technologies, not substitutes
- Information accuracy is a critical driver of production system performance

## Business Impact
- Lower inventory holding cost
- Improved fill rate and service level
- Reduced manual counting and non-value-added activities
- Better alignment between planning and execution

## Tools & Concepts
Inventory Modeling, EOQ, Reorder Point, Safety Stock, RFID Systems, Barcoding, Production Planning, Supply Chain Analytics
